## sjs - Safety Javascript - Utility Library

Hello and Welcome to this repository.

*Sjs* is a collection of algorithms and functions wrote during my studies at [Bov Academy](https://www.bovacademy.com).



Unlike many other js libraries, Sjs aims to be **strongly-typed**. The main benefit to being *strongly-type* is that 

when you pass an argument to a function, the Library checks if it belongs to an expected *data type*. 

If this is not the case, the System throws a *TypeError* Exception.



Functions are collected and categorized under various *namespaces* using dedicated tags:



| Namespace | Description              | Access    |
| :-------: | ------------------------ | --------- |
|     A     | Animations               | sjs.A     |
|    DOM    | Access to the DOM        | sjs.DOM   |
|     E     | Extra Functions          | sjs.E     |
|     F     | Functional Programming   | sjs.F     |
|     U     | Utility functions        | sjs.U     |
|     V     | Validator Functions      | sjs.V     |
|   types   | Collection of Data Types | sjs.types |
